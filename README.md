https://mediogrecoder.github.io/API-Pokemon-Battler/

## Description

This project is a browser based game revolving around a childhood classic of Pokemon where two players can choose from up to 900+ pokemons. As an ongoing project, this game will be updated and features will be added periodically as well as mobile friendly formatting.

## Technologies Used

1. API - Dynamic Fetching
2. CSS Animations

## Thoughts and Approach

## Instructions

1. Open burger menu on the top left
2. Both playes will choose a pokemon, choices can be cycled via Gen or random buttons
3. Once chosen, a new pokemon can be re-chosen until the battle icon is clicked
4. After the battle icon is clicked, the field for battle will be set up and the pokemon attack moves will replace the pokemon artwork
5. Take turns choosing attacks until one pokemon has fainted
6. A new game button will apear and the players can then choose their new pokemon

## Unsolved Issues

1. Not Mobile compatible
2. pokemon dying animation shifts boxes
3. CSS and animations not compatible with Safari or FireFox
